# afrcc_cpp
A Free Resuable Clean Code, free software repo for Core C++ functionality

The goal for the afrcc repos is to provide free software for generations to come.

The philosophy behind those repos is inspired by Jon Hall Maddog:

Maddog explains free software versus Open Source:
>>>
When discussing the difference between free software and open source software licenses, Hall said, “Open source benefits the developer.” Basically, he explained, in order to use code that someone else has written, you need a license that says, ok, go ahead and use it, and these are the terms and conditions to follow. MIT and BSD licenses, for example, are considered permissive licenses, so all you really have to do is tell people where the code came from and so forth. “You can use it, you can create your own distribution, and you do not have to distribute the source code,” Hall said. 

“It doesn’t do anything for the end user really,” he said. The user can’t change it or fix it, and if the developer loses interest, it may become unusable. 

Free software, on the other hand, has the same permissive guidance about getting and using the software, but it has a very strict set of rules to follow to be able to distribute your binaries. You have to make your source code available, you have to tell people how to build it, and you have to give people the ability to fix their own problems or make their own changes. That, Hall said, is the biggest difference between open source licenses and free software licenses, meaning mostly the GPL.

Participants and ideas for features are welcome.

The code shall be developed with disciplines and practices as teached by Uncle Bob -> https://cleancoders.com/
The C++ code shall be designed with great influence by the vast experience from the guys of Bloomberg -> John Lakos - Large-Scale C++ Volume I: Process and Architecture
Good social human behaviour is king, as lived for example by Ghandi.

Let's create free software for the future of our kids an theirs.
